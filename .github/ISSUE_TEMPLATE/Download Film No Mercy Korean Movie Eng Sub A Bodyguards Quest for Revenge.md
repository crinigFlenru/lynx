The film also does not offer a happy or satisfying ending, but rather a bleak and tragic one that may leave some viewers frustrated or depressed. The film is a dark and grim journey that does not offer much relief or comfort.

It is a film that will make you appreciate the bond between sisters and the courage of women. It is a film that will make you angry, sad, and hopeful at the same time.
